# Data-Structures-Lab
1.Write a program to add, subtract, multiply, divide and find the modulus for two integers using user defined functions with return type.

2. Write a program to find the sum of digits of a number and print the reverse of the number using recursion.

3. Write a program to add and multiply two matrices using pointers.

4. A structure stores the x & y coordinates of a point on the screen, a rectangle structure
stores the coordinates of the upper left & the lower right points corners of a rectangle. Write
a function that accepts rectangle structure r as an argument and computes the area of r.

5. Design, develop and implement a menu driven program in C for the searching techniques on arrays:
   a. Linear search, b. Binary search. If unsorted array is given as input, the program must perform sorting (bubble sort) to use it as input for the binary search algorithm.

6. Write a C program for array representation of Stack /Queue with basic functions.

7. Write a C program to convert an infix expression to postfix expression.

8. Write a C program to convert an infix expression to prefix expression.

9. Write a C program to evaluate a Postfix expression.

10. Write a C program to implement the Tower of Hanoi problem using recursion.

11. Write a C program to perform the following operations on a Circular QUEUE of Characters
    a. Insert, b.Delete, c. Demonstrate Overflow and Underflow situations.

12. Implement the following operations (demonstration of stack and Queues) on Singly Linked List (SLL) / Doubly Linked List (DLL) of Student Data with the fields: RollNo, Name, Semester 
    a. Create a SLL of N Students Data by using front insertion, b. Display the count of nodes in it, c. Perform Insertion / Deletion at End of SLL, d. Perform Insertion / Deletion at the front of SLL.

13. Write a C program to implement addition of 2 polynomial linked lists.

14. Implement a menu driven Program in C for the following operations on Binary Search Tree (BST) of Integers 6, 9, 5, 2, 8, 15, 24, 14, 7, 8, 5, 2 as input. 
    a. Create a BST of N Integers, b. Traverse the BST in In-order, Pre-order and Post-order, c. Search the BST for a given element (KEY) and report the parent.

15. Implement a program to create a binary expression tree given string of postfix expression as input and perform In-order, Pre-order and Post-order traversal.

16. Implement a program in C for the following operations on Graph(G) of Cities
    a. Create a Graph of N cities using Adjacency Matrix, b. Print all the nodes reachable from a given starting node in a digraph using DFS/BFS method.

17. Write a C program to implement file operations:
    a. Open a file, b. Write, c. Read, d. Close.
