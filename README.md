# Data Structures Lab

This repository contains a collection of programs completed as part of the Data Structures Laboratory course in the 2nd year of my udergrad. 

## Program List

### 1. Arithmetic Operations using User Defined Functions

**Description:** This program allows you to perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus) on two integers using user-defined functions with return types.

**File:** [1.c](1.c)

### 2. Sum of Digits and Reverse using Recursion

**Description:** This program calculates the sum of digits and prints the reverse of a given number using recursion.

**File:** [2.c](2.c)

### 3. Matrix Operations using Pointers

**Description:** This program performs addition and multiplication of two matrices using pointers.

**File:** [3.c](3.c)

### 4. Area of a Rectangle using Structures

**Description:** This program defines structures for a point and a rectangle, and then calculates the area of the rectangle using a function that accepts a rectangle structure as an argument.

**File:** [4.c](4.c)

### 5. Array Searching Techniques and Sorting

**Description:** This program demonstrates linear and binary search on arrays. If an unsorted array is given, it performs bubble sort to use binary search. The menu-driven program allows selecting the desired search technique.

**File:** [5.c](5.c)

### 6. Array Representation of Stack and Queue

**Description:** This program demonstrates the array representation of both a stack and a queue, including basic functions.

**File:** [6.c](6.c)

### 7. Infix to Postfix Conversion

**Description:** This program converts an infix expression to a postfix expression.

**File:** [7.c](7.c)

### 8. Infix to Prefix Conversion

**Description:** This program converts an infix expression to a prefix expression.

**File:** [8.c](8.c)

### 9. Postfix Expression Evaluation

**Description:** This program evaluates a postfix expression.

**File:** [9.c](9.c)

### 10. Tower of Hanoi using Recursion

**Description:** This program solves the Tower of Hanoi problem using recursion.

**File:** [10.c](10.c)

### 11. Circular Queue Operations

**Description:** This program demonstrates operations on a circular queue, including insertions, deletions, and handling overflow/underflow situations.

**File:** [11.c](11.c)

### 12. Singly Linked List and Doubly Linked List Operations

**Description:** This program performs various operations on singly linked lists (SLL) and doubly linked lists (DLL) of student data. Operations include creation, display, insertion, and deletion.

**File:** [12.c](12.c)

### 13. Addition of Polynomial Linked Lists

**Description:** This program implements the addition of two polynomial linked lists.

**File:** [13.c](13.c)

### 14. Binary Search Tree (BST) Operations

**Description:** This program demonstrates operations on a Binary Search Tree (BST) of Integers 6, 9, 5, 2, 8, 15, 24, 14, 7, 8, 5, 2 as input. 

a. Create a BST of N Integers, 

b. Traverse the BST in In-order, Pre-order and Post-order, 

c. Search the BST for a given element (KEY) and report the parent.

**File:** [14.c](14.c)

### 15. Binary Expression Tree Traversal

**Description:** This program creates a binary expression tree from a postfix expression and performs in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals.

**File:** [15.c](15.c)

### 16. Graph Operations using DFS and BFS

**Description:** This program implements operations on a graph (G) of cities, including creation using an adjacency matrix and finding reachable nodes from a given starting node using DFS/BFS.

**File:** [16.c](16.c)

### 17. File Operations

**Description:** This program demonstrates file operations such as opening a file, writing to it, reading from it, and closing it.

**File:** [17.c](17.c)

## Instructions to Run

### Running on Ubuntu (gcc)

1. Make sure you have GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) installed on your system.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the program files.

3. Compile a program using the following command (replace `<program_file.c>` with the actual filename):

   ```
   gcc -o output <program_file.c>
   ```

4. Run the compiled program using:

   ```
   ./output
   ```

### Online Compilers

You can also run these programs on various online compilers and debuggers. Here are a few options:

1. **Online GDB**: An online debugger and compiler based on the GNU Debugger.
   - Link: [Online GDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler)
   - Copy and paste the code into the editor, then compile and run.

2. **Programiz**: An online code editor and compiler.
   - Link: [Programiz C Compiler](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler/)
   - Paste the code into the editor and hit the "Compile and Run" button.

3. **Ideone**: An online compiler and debugging tool.
   - Link: [Ideone](https://ideone.com/)
   - Paste the code into the editor and click the "Run" button.
